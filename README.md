# Codetest-Mortageplan

Java version 16 or higher.

I used IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to code the project, but it should work with any other Java IDE.

When building it i used gradel.

To run the Relese make shure the prospect.text is in the same directory as the MortagePlan.jar just enter 

java -jar "MortagePlan.jar"

into powershell/cmd. Also make shure the powershell/cmd is in the release directory
